HelpCleaner Policy Statement
-----------------------------

This document outlines the official policies and guidelines for the usage, support, and extension submissions for HelpCleaner. 
Our goal is to ensure a safe, productive, and collaborative environment for all users while maintaining clarity and professionalism.

1. Support for Cleanups:
   HelpCleaner is designed to assist users in maintaining a clean and optimized environment. 
   However, software operations may occasionally produce unintended results due to the variability of user systems and configurations.
   
   In the event that an issue arises during or after a cleanup process, users are encouraged to contact our support team. 
   Our team will make every reasonable effort to investigate, provide guidance, and assist in resolving any problems encountered.
   
   Users should provide detailed information when requesting support, including:
     - A description of the issue
     - Steps leading up to the problem
     - Relevant system information
     - Any error messages observed
     
   While we strive to offer timely assistance, HelpCleaner is provided “as is,” and support does not guarantee complete recovery from all issues. 
   Users are advised to back up their environments before performing cleanup operations.

2. Extensions (.cs):
   HelpCleaner will soon support custom extensions, provided in the form of .cs files. 
   These extensions are intended to enhance user environments by introducing additional functionality, automation, or customization features.
   
   Submission Guidelines:
     - Extensions are now being accepted on a limited basis.
     - Each individual may submit a maximum of 10 extensions per week.
     - Daily submission limit: 1 extension per day per person.
     - From the following week onward, the same individual may submit up to 10 new extensions per week.
     - Practically, this allows for a maximum of 2 extensions per person per day, distributed across the week.
   
   All submitted extensions are subject to review to ensure they meet HelpCleaner’s standards for security, functionality, and compatibility. 
   Approved extensions will be made available to the broader community with appropriate attribution.

4. General Policies:
   - Users are responsible for ensuring that they follow best practices when using HelpCleaner.
   - Any redistribution of HelpCleaner or its extensions should comply with the licensing and attribution requirements specified in the official license.
   - We reserve the right to modify these policies as needed to maintain the integrity, safety, and functionality of HelpCleaner.
